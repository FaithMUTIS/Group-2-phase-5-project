PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Car Valuation System aims to modernize vehicle pricing for insurance companies and
auto resellers by employing a machine learning-based solution for accurate, objective, and
data-driven market appraisals. Traditional valuation methods are labor-intensive,
subjective, and inconsistent, leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among
stakeholders. This project seeks to streamline the process through technology, improving
precision and operational efficiency

AIM OF THE PROJECT

To develop a machine-learning-powered system that predicts a carâ€™s market value based on
its attributes, enhancing pricing accuracy and operational efficiency.
