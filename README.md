# CAR VALUATION SYSTEM
![alt text](download.jpg)

PROJECT OVERVIEW

The Car Valuation System aims to modernize vehicle pricing for insurance companies and
auto resellers by employing a machine learning-based solution for accurate, objective, and
data-driven market appraisals. Traditional valuation methods are labor-intensive,
subjective, and inconsistent, leading to inefficiencies and dissatisfaction among
stakeholders. This project seeks to streamline the process through technology, improving
precision and operational efficiency

AIM OF THE PROJECT

To develop a machine-learning-powered system that predicts a car’s market value based on
its attributes, enhancing pricing accuracy and operational efficiency.

Data Understanding

We have sourced historical car sales data, including:

Car Details: make, model, year, fuel type, engine size, transmission, body type
Condition Indicators: mileage, service history, accident history, condition ratings
Market Information: location, seasonal factors, regional pricing trends
Pricing: original sale price, resale values

BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Accurate car valuation is critical for insurance companies and car resellers. Insurance firms
require precise appraisals to set premiums and calculate claim settlements, while resellers
rely on competitive pricing for profitability. Current methods often lack reliability and
consistency. The proposed system leverages historical car data, including attributes like
make, model, mileage, and condition, to train machine learning models such as linear
regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting. The solution offers real-time,
user-friendly appraisals, improving decision-making, operational efficiency, and
stakeholder trust.

TOOLS AND TECHNOLOGIES

The tools, libraries and frameworks used include:

Python
Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
Matplotlib, Seaborn (for visualization)
Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab

APPROACH

We used the following steps;

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and encoding data, handling missing values.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Key insights, trends, and correlations.
Feature Engineering: Feature selection, scaling, etc.
Model Development: Algorithms tested and chosen were Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree Regressor, KNeighbors Regressor, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Evaluation: Metrics used, such as RMSE, MAE, or R².

RESULTS

KNN Regressor proved its capability in generating a good prediction model with a better trade-off between bias and variance error. With hyper parameter tuning using grid search CV, it showed a better accuracy than the standard solution, multiple linear regression. Therefore, KNN Bagging Regressor was chosen as the final model.
