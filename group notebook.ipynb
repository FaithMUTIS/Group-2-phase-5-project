    "In the growing used car market, determining a fair price for vehicles is a challenge for buyers and sellers alike. Variations in car prices can be influenced by numerous factors, such as mileage, model year, location, and fuel type, making valuations inconsistent and difficult. This project aims to use machine learning techniques to create an intelligent car valuation and recommendation system, helping users obtain accurate price estimates based on objective data. By leveraging historical car data, the system will streamline the decision-making process for both buyers and sellers, enhancing transparency and trust in the valuation process."
